# 5) Squash some bugs! 
# Find the possible logical errors (bugs)

### (b)
# The code is missing an "s" in the last line, which is the only letter that
# differentiates the objects
strings = ''
for string in ['I', 'am', 'Groot']:
    #strings = string+"_"+string
    strings = strings+"_"+string

### (c) Careful!
# This while loop will never end since j will be always greater than 0
j=10
while j > 0:
   #j += 1
    j -= 1
    
### (d)
# productory object will be always be equal to 0 since it is the initial 
# number stored
#productory = 0
productory = 1
for elem in [1, 5, 25]:
    productory *= elem
