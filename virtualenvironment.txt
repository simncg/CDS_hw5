#  Virtual Environment creation using Conda  #
#--------------------------------------------#

# Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps:


# 1. Create an environment with a specific python version (you can change to the version that you need)
conda create --name virtualenv_hw5 python=3.8.11

# Now the environment is located into the envs directory in the conda directory.
# This creates the virtualenv_hw5 environment in /envs/. No packages have been installed in this environment.

# 2. Activate the environment 
conda activate virtualenv_hw5

# 3. Install in the new environment all packages needed, for example:
pip install sklearn numpy seaborn matplotlib jupyter pandas

# To see the installed packages 
conda list
